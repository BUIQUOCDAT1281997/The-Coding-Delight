# The AVL tree implementation

Hello and welcome! All the source code regarding the AVL tree implementation guide on my [blog](https://www.thecodingdelight.com/avl-tree-implementation-java/) is available here.

Note that the AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. It balances itself by performing rotations by checking itself on insertion/deletion.

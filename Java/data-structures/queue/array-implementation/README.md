# Queue Array Implementation

Hello, 

All the implementations of the queue data structure that uses a regular array as the underlying data structure will be posted here.

## API

Basic API documentation for the queue interface.

## `enqueue(T data)`

Add data to the front of the queue.

## `dequeue()`

Remove the first item or the item at the front of the queue. Not to be confused with dequeue (double-ended queue). 
Return the item that was removed.

E.g. 
    ```queue.enqueue(1);          // Add item to the front of the queue
    int one = queue.dequeue(); // 1```

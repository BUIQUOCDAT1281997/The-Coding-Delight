# Queue Implementation using Linked Lists

This is a simple queue data structure implementation using the linked list as the underlying data structure. The blog post will be coming very shortly. 

P.S. I apologize for the lack of blog posts in the last couple of weeks. It has been very busy and I have not been able to spend any time working on providing content. 
Although right now, I am still busy, I hope to be able to write more, provide more content and write mode code during any little downtime that I have.

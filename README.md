# The Coding Delight

Welcome!

All source code from blog posts made on <a href="http://thecodingdelight.com">The coding delight</a> will be uploaded here. Thecodingdelight is my personal outlet for me to express what I love. I am committed to continue posting regularly. Hopefully, readers find the content interesting, informative and engaging. 

I also love constructive feedback as well, so please feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions. 

## Programming Languages

I will be blogging on the following languages

* Java
* JavaScript
* C++

I will generally be posting on whatever topic that comes to my mind, but if suggestions are made, I may focus my energy towards first creating a post that addresses what was suggested.
Later on, I also plan on writing blogs on database design, SQL, etc. 

## Other Content

Of course, there will be posts that are more general such as data structures and algorithms, design patterns, Object-oriented design and analysis, etc. I may also post more personal blogs of my experiences in Korea as a software developer.

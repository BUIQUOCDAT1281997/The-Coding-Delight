# Merge Sort Algorithm

This repo contains the source code for the JavaScript implementation of the <a href="http://www.thecodingdelight.com/merge-sort-algorithm-tutorial/">merge sort</a> algorithm. Please leave a comment if the post helped you. Peace!

The ```mergeSortBlind.js``` file contains a code snippet containing the merge sort algorithm that I coded blindly in 20 minutes, by drawing up a powerpoint slide for me to be able to visualize the algorithm again. 
It will be used in an upcoming posts on algorithmic problem solving, where I describe my thought process when writing algorithms.

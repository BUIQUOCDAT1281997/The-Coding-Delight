# Linked List

Please bear with me for a moment. I am currently in the process of re-vamping some of my older posts, which is why I am writing a linked list implementation.
This was literally put together in an hour and 30 minutes, so I still need to add the features specified in the UML in my blog post on linked lists.

In the meanwhile, please bear with me. I will try and finish it up as soon as possible. 

The add() and remove() method should work fine so please feel free to play around with that.
